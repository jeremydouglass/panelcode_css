Directional overrides for consoles

I spent a while spinning my wheels trying to figure out the Marked 2 bug -- it turned out that Javascript was actively rewriting my rtl / lrt tags, so nothing was having the effect that I expected. All of this code turned out to be unnecessary once the consoles were correctly defined.

At any rate, RTL-marked galleries were printing console controls and console content from the right margin, with backwards syntax clauses on the panelcode. Terrible! But it was fixed without needing any of this:


*[dir="ltr"] { direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; }

*[dir="rtl"] { direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed; }

bdo[dir="ltr"] { direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: bidi-override; }

bdo[dir="rtl"] { direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: bidi-override; }

div.gallery.prtl {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details summary {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details[open] {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details pre {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details[open] pre {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details pre code {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details[open] pre code {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details pre code.panelcode {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details[open] pre code.panelcode {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details code {
  direction: ltr !important;
}
div.gallery.prtl details[open] code {
  direction: ltr !important;
}

/* gallery console visibility override */

/*

These aren't currently necessary because the preparser renders
the console or doesn't based on the presence of these keywords
in the Panelcode -- so checking class tags to show / hide isn't
needed. However, this is an alternate approach that might give
more flexibility without re-rendering.

.gallery.nocode select {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.nocode:hover select {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.noconsole details {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.noconsole select {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.noconsole:hover select {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.noconsole details {
  display: none;
}

*/

/*

Suppress console for dropcaps

.dropcap details {
  display: none !important;
}
.gallery.dropcap:hover select {
  display: none;
}
.gallery.dropcap select {
  display: none;
}

*/
